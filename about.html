                <p>Hello!<br>My name is Raul, I live in Delicias, MX.<br>I spent around 17 years in the 
                automation engineering field. During my time as project lead, I noticed that software development
                and technology are an essential part of me. As project lead, I had no time for getting more 
                involved, technically speaking. So, I decided to change to become a software developer. And here I am.
                <br>Want to have a talk about technology, software, construction or just hang?<br>
